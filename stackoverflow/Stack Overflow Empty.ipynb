    "\n",
    "Every year, the online academic resume service, ORCID, dumps the data from all of the professors who have their privacy settings set to “public” so that the research community can learn about the makeup of the academic workforce. In this real-data problem, we’re going to study the flows of professors between different academic fields to learn about gender differences. We’ll use a pre-processed dataset used by actual researchers studying gender imbalance across fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some information about the data. For each of the 1.6 million professors in the public ORCID data dump, the researchers determined (a) what field they are currently in, (b) what field they did their PhD in, and (c) their gender. Here, because the goal of the study was originally to learn about disparities between men and women, gender was coded by the researchers as male or female, as indicated by the professors. Those who chose not to mark their gender as public were not included in the processed dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers have provided CSCI 3022 with two files: **totals.csv** and **switch_edgelist.csv**. The first file enumerates the total numbers of men and women in each of $30$ different fields. The second file enumerates the total numbers of men and women who switched from one field to another field during their career.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis about the data is that the gender balance of people leaving field $X$ is the same as the gender balance in field $X$. For example, if Anthropology is $50\\%$ women and $50\\%$ men, we expect people who have moved from Anthropology to another field to reflect this $50/50$ balance. On the other hand, if Physics is only $15\\%$ women and $85\\%$ men, we expect people who have moved from Physics to another field to reflect a $15/85$ balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In symbolic form, we might write this as follows. Let the proportion of professors in field i who are women be given by $p_i$, and let the proportion of women who move from field i to some other field be given by $q_i$. Then the expected result is that $p_i$ = $q_i$. The researchers are interested to know if there is statistical evidence that $p_i \\neq q_i$ for any of the fields $i$."
